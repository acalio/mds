# Overview
BRICS is the acronym coined to associate five major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. 

Since 2009, the governments of the BRICS states have met annually at formal summits. 

Originally the first four were grouped as "BRIC" (or "the BRICs") before the induction of South Africa in 2010.

Nations included in the BRICS initiative have a combined area 39,746,220 km2 (~26% of the world surface)  and estimated population of
13.21 billion (~41% of the world population).

As regards economics, these five states combine for the approximately the 23% of total gross world product and 
around the 32% of the world's GDP. 

In this context, it would be interesting to address the following questions:
* Is there any correlation between emerging economies and their impacts on social welfare?
* Is there any connection between a country's education and the employment rate? 

The above questions are just an example, in fact this data enable the possibility to better understand 
the characteristics of these society, in general. 

That said, imagine you are hired by a high-end world wide organization (e.g., the United Nation) to estimate
GDP Per Capita (Constant LCU) of these countries will evolve at how these countries in the future. 
 
Concretely, you need to build  a model that is able to provide, with sufficient accuracy,
a short-term or  mid-term forecasting of a country GDP per capita.
