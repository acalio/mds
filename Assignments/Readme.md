# Project Walkthrough
Please use the following list as a reference for all the 
steps required to address any of the assignment of this course.

1. Formally define the problem
   - introduce the problem, explain why it is important
   - you can also define multiple problems!
2. Frame the problem
   - provide a high level overview of how you want to address the problem
3. Get the data
   - possibly merging multiple sources of information
   - 
3. Explore the data
   - visualize your data with the purpose of gaining insights about the
	 characteristics of the data at hand
4. Preprocessing
   - prepare the data to apply the ML algorithms
   - try to think in terms of transformation pipelines to provide flexible and clean approaches
5. Train the algorithms
   - train a selection of algorithms 
   - evaluate performance on the training and the validation set
6. Fine tune the model
   - apply parameter tuning on a subset of the above algorithms (the most promising ones)
7. Ensemble learning
   - try to boost the performance of your solution by combining together the best models into an ensemble
8. Conclusions
   - determine which model should be deployed in production
   - discuss what you have learned through the process
